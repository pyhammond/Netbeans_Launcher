# Netbeans_Launcher
A shell script and Automator App that Launch Apache NetBeans with my ssh-agent configuration and also connects to our company's VPN at the same time.

## Files
There are just two files in this repo:
1. [ssh_launcher.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyhammond/Netbeans_Launcher/main/ssh_launcher.sh "Raw Shell Code") is the shell script containing the commands built into the Automater App.
2. [NetBeans Launcher.app](https://github.com/pyhammond/Netbeans_Launcher/raw/main/NetBeans%20Launcher.zip "Zipped MacOS App") is the App version built in Automator that contains the code in the above shell script.  Feel free to open it in Automator and edit it if necessary.

Best of luck !
